Welcome to the webpage for the WABI 2025 conference.  WABI 2025 will be held at the University of Maryland, in College Park, MD from August 20 - 22, 2025.

## <u> Keynote Speakers </u>

This year WABI will have keynote addresses by [Christina Boucher](https://www.christinaboucher.com/) and [Ben Langmead](https://www.langmead-lab.org/)!

## Scope

WABI is an international Conference covering research in algorithmic work in bioinformatics, computational biology and systems biology. The emphasis is mainly on discrete algorithms and machine learning methods that address important problems in molecular biology, that are founded on sound models, that are computationally efficient, and that provide evidence of their potential usefulness in practice, preferably by testing on appropriately chosen simulated or real datasets. The goal is to present recent research results, including significant work-in-progress, and to identify and explore directions of future research. 

## Registration

You can register for WABI 2025 [using this link](https://go.umd.edu/wabi25payment).

## Paper submission

You can submit your work to WABI [here](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wabi2025).

#### SCOPE  
WABI is an international conference covering research in algorithmic work in bioinformatics, computational biology and systems biology. The emphasis is mainly on discrete algorithms and machine-learning methods that address important problems in molecular biology, that are founded on sound models, that are computationally efficient, and that provide evidence of their potential usefulness in practice, preferably by testing on appropriately chosen simulated or real datasets. The goal is to present recent research results, including significant work-in-progress, and to identify and explore directions of future research.

### PAPER SUBMISSION

Submissions must be formatted in LaTeX using the LIPIcs style and must not exceed 15 pages excluding the front page (authors, affiliation, keywords, abstract, ...), references and a brief appendix (of up to 5 pages). For details please see the information for authors [https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs\#author](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author).

Each paper must contain a succinct statement of the issues and of their motivation, a summary of the main results, and a brief explanation of their significance, all accessible to non-specialist readers. All submissions must be made online, through the EasyChair submission system, at:

[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wabi2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wabi2025)

For scientific information, please contact one of the WABI program committee co-chairs, Broňa Brejová ([brejova@fmph.uniba.sk](mailto:brejova@fmph.uniba.sk)) or Rob Patro ([rob@cs.umd.edu](mailto:rob@cs.umd.edu)). For additional organizational information, please refer to this website, or contact the local chair, Mihai Pop ([mpop@umd.edu](mailto:mpop@umd.edu)).

An abstract of the paper must be received in EasyChair by May 09, 2025 (time zone of your choice) in order for your submission to be considered. Submission of full versions for already submitted papers will be possible until May 12, 2025 (time zone of your choice). Simultaneous submission to another conference with published proceedings is not permitted, but simultaneous submission to a journal is allowed, provided that the authors notify the program chairs; if published in a journal, such a contribution will be published as a short abstract in the WABI proceedings. Depositing in [arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org) or [biorxiv.org](http://biorxiv.org) is encouraged.

By submitting a paper, the authors acknowledge that, in case of acceptance at least one of the authors must register for WABI 2025 and present the paper.

Accepted papers will be published in the WABI proceedings in the [LIPIcs Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics](https://www.dagstuhl.de/publikationen/lipics/).

Selected papers will be invited for an extended publication in a thematic series in [Algorithms for Molecular Biology (AMB)](http://almob.biomedcentral.com/).
